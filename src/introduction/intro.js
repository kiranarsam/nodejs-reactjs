 * What is React?
 * Sometimes referred to as a frontend JavaScript framework, is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.
 *
 * React is a tool for building UI components.
 *
 * How does React Work?
 * 1. React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
 *
 * Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where
 * it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
 *
 * 2. React only changes what needs to be changes
 * React finds out what changes have been made, and changes 'only' what needs to be changed.
