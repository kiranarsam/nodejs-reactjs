/**
 * React Router:
 * Create React App doesn't include page routing.
 * React Router is the most popular solution.
 *
 * Add React Router
 * To add React Router in your application, run this in the terminal from the root directory of the application.
 *
 * npm i -D react-router-dom
 *
 * Note: This uses React Router v6
 * If you are upgrading from v5, you will need to use the @latest flag.
 *
 *  npm i -D react-router-dom@latest
 *
 * Folder Structure:
 * TO create an application with multiple page routes, let's first start with the file structure.
 *
 * Within the 'src' folder, we'll create a folder named 'pages' with serveral files
 * src\pages\
 *      Layout.js
 *      Home.js
 *      Blogs.js
 *      Contact.js
 *      NoPage.js
 *
 * Each file will contain a very basic React component.
 *
 * Basic Usage:
 * Now we will use our Router in our 'index.js' file.
 *
 * Example:
 * Use React Router to route to pages based on URL
